# NHS Hours Tracker

## Purpose
**Automate** hour checking for National Honors Society (NHS) Students.

We have over 300 students participating in NHS each year, so manually accumulating hours is quite a hassle. Furthermore, the hours need to be sorted by non-NHS and NHS-specific hours, with different criteria based on grade level. This was the motivation to create this codeâ€”make the process simpler not just for the students, but also for the NHS leadership to verify, calculate, and award people's community service.

## Description
This script pulls data from current and last year spreadsheets, calculates roll-over hours for current seniors, manipulates data, and sends an automated email to students with their hours on request. This was written in Google Apps Script, but the underlying language is still JavaScript. It is meant to be run with Google Sheets. 

> NOTE: Idenitifying information has been redacted, you will have to change the spreadsheets IDs yearly.
